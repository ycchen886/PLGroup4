# PLGroup4

A DSL that generates intelligible writing based on parameters for keywords, length, and boolean filters. We use a Markov chain and n-gram representation to find the probabilistic relationship between words by building unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams from books on Project Gutenburg. Using this data, we are able to predict when words ought to be used in the context of related words and then create comprehensible sentences and paragraphs.
